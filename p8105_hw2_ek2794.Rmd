### Problem 1 NYC Subway System 

```{r, ECHO = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(haven)
library(dplyr)

```


We will import the csv file here.
```{r}
mta_df = read_csv(file = "./NYC_mta.csv", col_types = cols(route8 = "c", route9 = "c", route10 = "c", route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route")

```

This dataset has 10 variables including line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, entry, vending, entrance type, ada, route number, and route value. There are 20,548 rows. Here we changed the entry variable from YES NO to `true` `false` with the mutate function. We changed the route 1 to route 11 from individual variables to a combined route_num variable and route variable to tidy up the data.


## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
