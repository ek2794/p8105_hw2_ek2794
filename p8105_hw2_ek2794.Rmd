### Problem 1 NYC Subway System 

```{r, ECHO = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(haven)
library(dplyr)




```


We will import the csv file here.
```{r}
mta_df = read_csv(file = "./NYC_mta.csv", col_types = cols(route8 = "c", route9 = "c", route10 = "c", route11 = "c")) %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, station_longitude, starts_with("route"), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>%
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)) %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route")

```

This dataset has 10 variables including line, station name, station latitude, station longitude, entry, vending, entrance type, ada, route number, and route value. There are 20,548 rows. Here we changed the entry variable from YES NO to `true` `false` with the mutate function. We changed the route 1 to route 11 from individual variables to a combined route_num variable and route variable to tidy up the data.


```{r}
distinct(mta_df, line, station_name)
```
## There are 465 distinct stations. 

```{r}
filter(mta_df, ada == "TRUE")
```

## There are 5148 ada compliant stations. 


```{r}
filter(mta_df, vending =="NO" & entry==TRUE)

```
There are 759 stops that allow both entry without vending.

### Problem 2 
```{r}
mrtrash_df = read_xlsx("Trash.xlsx", sheet = "Mr. Trash Wheel",
  range = "A2:N535") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  drop_na(dumpster) %>%
  mutate(
    dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster),
    year = as.numeric(year),
    sports_balls = as.integer(round(sports_balls, digits= 0)),
    role = paste('mr', row_number(), sep = '_')) %>%
    relocate(role) 

professor_trashwheel_df = read_xlsx("Trash.xlsx", sheet = "Professor Trash Wheel", range = "A2:N116") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(
    dumpster = as.numeric(dumpster)) %>%
  filter(dumpster >0) %>%
  mutate(
    role = paste("professor", row_number(), sep = "_")) %>%
  relocate(role) 

total_trashwheel = bind_rows(mrtrash_df, professor_trashwheel_df)

```

With our cleaned file, mrtrash_df is the cleaned up Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet and professor_trashwheel_df is the cleaned up Professor Trashwheel Sheet that now both have 15 variables that include the role (mr or professor labels with line row), dumpster number, month, year, date, weight_tons, volume in cubic yards, plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette butts, glass bottles, grocery bags, chips bags, sports balls, and home powered. 

The Mr. Trash Wheel Sheet has a total of 454 observations. Professor Trash Wheel has a total of 71 observations. Together, in the combined `total_trashwheel` document, there are a combined 525 observations. 

```

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is = 
`sum(pull(professor_trashwheel_df, weight_tons))`


The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is = `sum(pull(mrtrash_df, sports_balls))`



### Problem 3 FiveThirtyEight 


Here we clean the pols-month.csv to break up the variable mon into integer variables year, month, and day. We replace the month number with the month name. We create a president variable taking values gop and dem and remove prez_dem and prez_gop. we remove the day variable.
```{r}
pols_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/pols-month.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
  separate(col=mon,into=c('year','month','day'), sep="-") %>%
  mutate(
    year = as.integer(year),
    month = as.integer(month),
    month = replace(month, month == "1", "January"),
    month = replace(month, month == "2", "February"),
    month = replace(month, month == "3", "March"),
    month = replace(month, month == "4", "April"),
    month = replace(month, month == "5", "May"),
    month = replace(month, month == "6", "June"),
    month = replace(month, month == "7", "July"),
    month = replace(month, month == "8", "August"),
    month = replace(month, month == "9", "September"),
    month = replace(month, month == "10", "October"),
    month = replace(month, month == "11", "November"),
    month = replace(month, month == "12", "December"),
    president = recode(prez_gop, "1" = "gop", "0" = "dem"))
    
pols_df<-select(pols_df,-c(day,prez_gop,prez_dem))

```

Second, clean the data in snp.csv using a similar process to the above. For consistency across datasets, arrange according to year and month, and organize so that year and month are the leading columns.

```{r}
library(lubridate)
```
```{r}
snp_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/snp.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
mutate(date = lubridate::mdy(date)) %>%
separate(col=date, into = c("year", "month", "date"), convert = TRUE) %>%
mutate(
year = as.integer(year),
month = as.integer(month),
month = replace(month, month == "1", "January"),
month = replace(month, month == "2", "February"),
month = replace(month, month == "3", "March"),
month = replace(month, month == "4", "April"),
month = replace(month, month == "5", "May"),
month = replace(month, month == "6", "June"),
month = replace(month, month == "7", "July"),
month = replace(month, month == "8", "August"),
month = replace(month, month == "9", "September"),
month = replace(month, month == "10", "October"),
month = replace(month, month == "11", "November"),
month = replace(month, month == "12", "December"))

snp_df<-select(snp_df,-date)
head(snp_df)
```

Third, tidy the unemployment data so that it can be merged with the previous datasets. This process will involve switching from “wide” to “long” format; ensuring that key variables have the same name; and ensuring that key variables take the same values.

```{r}
unemployment_df = read_csv("./fivethirtyeight_datasets/unemployment.csv") %>%
janitor::clean_names() %>%
pivot_longer(
jan:dec,
names_to="month",
values_to="unemployment") %>%
mutate(
year = as.integer(year),
month = replace(month, month == "jan", "January"),
month = replace(month, month == "feb", "February"),
month = replace(month, month == "mar", "March"),
month = replace(month, month == "apr", "April"),
month = replace(month, month == "may", "May"),
month = replace(month, month == "jun", "June"),
month = replace(month, month == "jul", "July"),
month = replace(month, month == "aug", "August"),
month = replace(month, month == "sep", "September"),
month = replace(month, month == "oct", "October"),
month = replace(month, month == "nov", "November"),
month = replace(month, month == "dec", "December"))

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
